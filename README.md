# My First Landing Page
This is my second project in the Odin Project curriculum. In this project I tried to replicate as well as I could the design that was provided (https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png). I put to the test my understanding of flexbox and tried to make the page responsive to different screen sizes.
